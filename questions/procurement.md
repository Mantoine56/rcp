# **REAL PROPERTY**

| Question | Result Type | Result that would flag compliance concern | Policy/Legislative requirement | Why this is important |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. How frequently does the Deputy Head meet with the Senior Designated Official for Real Property to discuss real property matters? | Frequency: - Less than annually - Annually - Less than quarterly but more than annually - Quarterly - More frequently than quarterly | Less than annually or annually | Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments (PPMI) 4.1 | The deputy head has ultimate accountability for the sound management of real property. As such, regular briefings from the Senior Designated Official for Real Property are critical in the deputy ensuring that their delegated authorities within the real property program are being managed. |
| 2. Based on data reported in the Directory of Federal Real Property, how has the condition of the organization’s real property portfolio changed over the last 3 fiscal years? | Percentage | Less than 0% for good and fair <br> Higher than 0% for poor and critical | PPMI 4.1.4.1 <br> Directive on the Management of Real Property (DMRP) 4.2.4 | A robust real property portfolio strategy drives change by describing how an organization’s real property assets will be intentionally and proactively managed. It shows an organization’s ability to make real property investment decisions that demonstrate best value and sound stewardship. |
| 3. For transactions completed by the organization in the last fiscal year, what proportion of these transactions have complete documentation to demonstrate compliance with relevant legal and policy requirements? | Percentage | Less than 90% | PPMI 4.1.3 <br> DMRP 4.1.1.4 | There are numerous legal and policy requirements to ensure that real property transactions are conducted in a fair, open and transparent manner, while demonstrating proper delegation of authorities and value to the Crown. |
| 4. What is the organization’s actual reinvestment rate for real property compared to its target reinvestment rate? | Percentage | Less than 60% | PPMI 4.1.18.8 | Establishing a target rate of annual reinvestment and understanding deferred maintenance liabilities for Crown-owned (custodial) real property is essential to assessing whether adequate resources are being dedicated to maintaining real property assets in an acceptable condition. Further, a comparison of the actual rate of reinvestment with the target rate may identify opportunities for deputy heads to adjust resource allocations to demonstrate sound stewardship and best value to the Crown. If the rate is not met, it suggests that real property assets are at risk of deteriorating faster than life-cycle forecasts predict, which may compromise program and service delivery. |
| 5. What is the level of maturity of the organization’s real property governance? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | PPMI 4.1, 4.1.3.3, 4.1.3.4, 4.1.4.1, <br> DMRP 4.1.2 | The Real Property Management Framework and associated governance structure outlines the organization’s ability to make real property investment decisions that demonstrate best value and sound stewardship. |
| 6. What is the level of maturity of the organization’s management of its real property assets? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | PPMI 4.1.18.1, 4.1.4, 4.1.1 <br> DMRP 4.1.2 | A strong asset management regime ensures that organizations have the real property necessary to accomplish their mandates and that their real property holdings provide best value. Having a lifecycle management plan in place minimizes the risk of loss and damage to real property holdings to ensure operational continuity. It also provides real property management practitioners with up-to-date information on the state of their real property assets to enable effective management through data-driven decision making for lifecycle maintenance, and the identification of surplus real property. |
| 7. What is the level of maturity of the organization’s real property transaction management? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | PPMI 4.1.18.1, 4.1.4, 4.1.1 | There are numerous legal and policy requirements to ensure that real property transactions are conducted in a fair, open and transparent manner, while demonstrating proper delegation of authorities and value to the Crown. |
| 8. What is the level of maturity of how the organization identifies and tracks against the target reinvestment rate using asset data? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | PPMI 4.1.18.1, 4.1.3.4, 4.1.3.5 | Understanding the need for a specific target rate of annual reinvestment and understanding deferred maintenance liabilities for Crown-owned (custodial) real property demonstrates an understanding of the portfolio’s requirements and is essential to assessing whether adequate resources are being dedicated to maintaining real property assets in an acceptable condition. Further, a comparison of the actual rate of reinvestment with the target rate may identify opportunities for deputy heads to adjust resource allocations in order to demonstrate sound stewardship and best value to the Crown. If the rate is not met, it suggests that real property assets are at risk of deteriorating faster than life-cycle forecasts predict, which may compromise program and service delivery. |

REAL PROPERTY: How organizations will calculate self-assessment responses

|  |  |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1: How frequently does the Deputy Head meet with the Senior Designated Official for Real Property to discuss real property matters? | Organizations are asked to select the frequency that best represents their response. <br>- Less than annually - Annually - Less than quarterly but more than annually<br>- Quarterly - More frequently than quarterly | A response of less than annually or annually indicates a potential compliance concern that may require deputy head attention. |  |  |
| Q2: Based on data reported in the Directory of Federal Real Property, how has the condition of the organization’s real property portfolio changed over the last 3 fiscal years? | Calculation method: <br> For properties in "good" and "fair" condition: Percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" and "fair" building condition for the most recent fiscal year – Percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" or "fair" condition 3 fiscal years ago = Response<br> How to calculate the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" and "fair" building condition for the most recent fiscal year. <br>Step 1: The organization is asked to count the number of its real property assets in "good" and "fair" building condition as per the Directory of Federal Real Property (DFRP) in the most recent fiscal year.<br>Step 2: The organization is asked to count the total number of its real property buildings per the DFRP in the most recent fiscal year.<br> Step 3: Divide the total number of real property assets in "good" and "fair" building condition by the total number of real property buildings per the data available in the DFRP.<br>Step 4: Multiply the number calculated in Step 3 by 100 to determine the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" and "fair" building condition for the most recent fiscal year. <br> How to calculate the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "poor" and "critical" condition for the most recent fiscal year. <br> Step 5: The organization is asked to count the number of its real property assets in "poor" and "critical" building condition as per the DFRP from 3 fiscal years ago.<br>Step 6: The organization is asked to count the total number of its real property assets from 3 fiscal years ago.<br> Step 7: Divide the total number of real property assets in "poor" and "critical" building condition from 3 years fiscal ago by the total number of real property assets from 3 fiscal years ago.<br>Step 8: Multiply the number calculated in Step 7 by 100 to determine the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "poor" and "critical" condition 3 fiscal years ago. How to calculate the response<br>Step 9: Subtract the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" and "fair" condition for the most recent fiscal year from the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "poor" and "critical" condition 3 fiscal years ago to determine the organization's response to this question in the self-assessment.  | If the condition trend of properties in "good" and "fair" condition shows a decrease (a response less than 0%), it indicates a potential compliance concern that may require a response from the deputy head. If the condition trend of properties in "poor" and "critical" condition shows an increase (a response higher than 0%), it indicates a potential compliance concern that may require a response from the deputy head. | Notes: The DFRP contains core information about the properties and buildings that currently support the fulfillment of federal program requirements. It excludes certain types of real property assets, including easements and access roads, interests under a certain size, offshore oil and gas lands, real property that is a reserve as defined in the Indian Act, non-agent Crown corporation holdings, and engineering assets. Please see the DFRP Input Guide for the complete list of exclusions. <br> A property is defined as a contiguous portion of land or improvements on the land administered by a single custodian and held under a single interest type. A building is defined as a structure that is permanently fixed to the land, usually roofed and walled, used or built for the shelter, accommodation or enclosure of persons, animals, materials or equipment. The definition excludes any structure or work, such as an object, that serves the purpose of a building but that is not fixed to the land. Such temporary structures, such as a trailer or mobile home, are considered materiel and not real property and are therefore not reportable in the DFRP. |  |

# FINANCIAL AND EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT

| Question | Result Type | Result that would flag compliance concern | Policy/Legislative requirement | Why this is important |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Did the organization conduct a full risk assessment or environmental scan of its internal controls over financial management and internal controls over financial reporting in 2024-25 and use the results to inform its internal control monitoring strategy? | Yes/No | No | Guide to Ongoing Monitoring of Internal Controls over Financial Management, Section 5 <br> Financial Administration Act 16.4<br> Policy on Financial Management 4.1.6 | Organizations should be aware of their current risk environment to ensure controls are designed to mitigate organizational risks are based on the most recent information available. <br> Organizations must also ensure the rigour of the risk assessments are sufficiently high. Organizations need to be confident that they understand their risks thoroughly so that they are testing their controls in accordance with their business process risk level. A thorough understanding of risks also provides an opportunity for the organization to ensure controls are designed appropriately to mitigate the organizational risks based on the most recent information available. |
| 2. What percentage of remediation actions for medium and high-risk internal control gaps or weaknesses were fully implemented within the established timelines during fiscal years 2022-23 to 2024-25? | Percentage - Organizations should select not applicable (N/A) if no remediation actions have been identified in the past three years. | Less than 75% | Guide to Ongoing Monitoring of Internal Controls over Financial Management, Section 5 <br> Policy on Financial Management 4.1.6 | Deficiencies in internal controls over financial management and reporting should be remediated in a timely fashion to ensure controls are effective and risks are mitigated. |
| 3. What is the organization’s level of maturity in financial governance, particularly in ensuring effective oversight and integrating financial management into decision-making? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | Policy on Financial Management, 4.1.2, 4.2.2 | Organization-wide financial governance ensures strong oversight, strategic alignment, and accountability in managing public resources. By embedding financial management into decision-making, organizations can anticipate risks, optimize resource allocation, and enhance program efficiency. A strong governance model maintains compliance while building on it, integrating financial insights into strategic planning to support long-term sustainability and performance. At its highest level, financial governance enables data-driven decision-making, fosters transparency, and strengthens public confidence in financial stewardship. |
| 4. What is the organization’s level of maturity in ensuring its financial information is accurate, timely and relevant to support decision-making and meet financial reporting requirements? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | Policy on Financial Management, 4.1.7, 4.2.11, 4.2.12, 4.2.13 <br> Directive on Performance and Talent Management for Executives, Appendix A | Organizations must ensure the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of financial information to support informed decision-making, accountability, and transparency. High-quality financial data strengthens financial stewardship, minimizes errors, enhances forecasting, and ensures compliance with Treasury Board policies. The financial information maturity model helps organizations assess and improve their ability to produce and use financial information effectively. Ensuring robust financial information reduces reporting risks and aligns with government-wide financial management requirements. |

| Level 0 | Level 1 | Level 2 | Level 3 | Level 4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q2: What percentage of remediation actions for medium and high-risk internal control gaps or weaknesses were fully implemented within the established timelines during fiscal years 2022-23 to 2024-25?<br> Organizations should select not applicable (N/A) if no remediation actions have been identified in the past three years.  | Financial information is unreliable, inconsistent and prone to inaccuracies. Processes for validation and reconciliation are weak, leading to frequent errors. Decision-makers lack confidence in reports due to frequent inaccuracies.<br> Decision-makers face challenges relying on financial reports due to ongoing inconsistencies. Reports from various sources (e.g., SAP, Excel spreadsheets) do not align, causing confusion among management. Financial reporting is compliance-driven rather than decision-supportive.<br> CFO attestation in Cabinet documents is primarily procedural, with financial assumptions inadequately validated due to gaps in reliable financial information. Reconciliation and financial oversight mechanisms are weak. <br>Reporting processes are informal, with errors frequently detected post-reporting rather than proactively addressed. Compliance risks exist due to fragmented financial reporting, limiting transparency and accuracy. <br>Financial information in external reports is inconsistent and prone to inaccuracies, with weak validation processes and oversight mechanisms failing to ensure compliance with policy expectations. | Financial information is becoming more structured but still lacks consistency, timeliness and clarity for decision-making. Manual data entry errors lead to discrepancies. Efforts are ongoing to improve data accuracy and standardization. <br>Decision-makers have access to reports, but reconciliation and alignment across functions remain inconsistent. Financial reporting is improving but still lacks full integration for strategic decision-making.<br> CFO attestation in Cabinet documents is improving, incorporating stronger due diligence and validation of financial assumptions, but remains limited in strategic validation and risk assessment. <br>Reporting processes are improving, with standardized reporting cycles in place. However, integration of variance analysis remains inconsistent, limiting its application in financial planning and decision support. <br>Efforts to enhance accuracy and reasonableness are ongoing, with greater emphasis on validation and quality control measures to reduce risks of misstatement. Transparency in reporting is increasing but still requires improvements. | Financial information is increasingly structured and reliable, with occasional inaccuracies and delays that impact decision-making and reporting. New reports and analytical tools are introduced, but user adoption lags, affecting reliability.<br>Financial insights inform planning and budgeting, but they are not yet fully embedded in decision-making. Reporting structures are in place, but consistency and timeliness require enhancements. <br>CFO attestation in Cabinet documents is more rigorous, leveraging due diligence and financial risk assessment to ensure sound decision-making. Stronger validation processes are being implemented.<br>Data governance frameworks are established, ensuring consistency and reliability in financial decision-making. Financial reporting aligns with policy requirements but is not yet fully optimized for efficiency. <br>External reporting is more accurate and policy-compliant, supporting transparent financial disclosures. Strong validation controls and oversight mechanisms improve reliability. Compliance risks are being mitigated through improved governance structures. | Financial information is consistently accurate and timely, supporting decision-making at all levels. Automated reconciliation processes reduce discrepancies and increase confidence in financial data. Integration across financial functions is strong. <br>Financial insights are well integrated across functions, improving decision-making and performance monitoring. Analytical tools are leveraged to support strategic initiatives.<br> CFO attestation in Cabinet documents follows a structured due diligence approach, ensuring validation of financial assumptions aligned with Treasury Board expectations. Strategic validation is embedded into financial decision-making. <br>High-quality financial information enables continuous performance monitoring, scenario analysis, and sustainability planning. Reporting cycles are well-established and standardized.<br> External reporting is fully aligned with policy requirements, ensuring accuracy, transparency and reliability in financial disclosures. Governance frameworks are in place to ensure compliance with financial policies. Reliable financial data allows for efficient and proactive communication with Central Agencies, ensuring alignment with government expectations and timely resolution of reporting issues. |
| Q3: What is the organization’s level of maturity in financial governance, particularly in ensuring effective oversight and integrating financial management into decision-making? Organizations should choose the maturity level which best represents its level of compliance and performance. <br> However, if an organization selects levels 1,2,3 or 4, but has not met the question's compliance elements (provided in Level 0), its response must indicate that there is a potential compliance concern and provide details about the issue. For example, "Level 3, with potential compliance concern".<br> Additional guidance about how to self-assess RCP maturity model questions can be found in the "guide on how to complete the RCP self assessments". | Governance structures are not well-defined, and financial management lacks formalization. Meetings are infrequent, with no structured agenda. Financial data is outdated or unavailable, leading to reactive decision-making and limited oversight of budget issues. <br> Oversight mechanisms are weak, and governance tends to be reactive. Financial reports are rarely reviewed, and audit findings go unaddressed. The CFO is seen as a financial controller, with minimal involvement in strategic discussions. Financial advice is transactional and compliance focused.<br> Senior delegated managers have varying awareness of financial responsibilities and need additional support to oversee financial management. Financial management is not consistently integrated into decision-making. <br>Budget setting is informal, disconnected from strategic planning, and primarily reactive. Funding allocations are based on past spending rather than priorities, with little coordination. Adjustments are made on an ad-hoc basis.<br> Budget managers have little visibility at the start of the fiscal year. Funding decisions are delayed, leading to uncertainty and reactive spending. Surpluses are identified late, leading to year-end overspending or lapsed funds, with no trend monitoring. | Governance exists at a basic level but is inconsistently applied. Meetings occur sporadically, and financial data is inconsistent. Reports are retrospective, focusing on past expenditures rather than trends. Decision-makers lack timely data for proactive oversight. <br> Oversight mechanisms such as regular financial reporting focus on compliance rather than strategy. Efforts to improve oversight are emerging, but gaps remain in coordination and strategic alignment. <br>The CFO is recognized and ensures compliance but has limited influence on strategic decisions. Provides financial reports but is not fully engaged in shaping strategies. <br>Senior delegated managers have minimal awareness of financial matters, leading to gaps in accountability and decision-making. <br> Some structured budget processes exist but are inconsistently applied and not fully integrated. Funding data is available, but budget managers receive incomplete or delayed details, causing spending delays. <br>Basic financial monitoring exists, but surplus identification is inconsistent and reactive. Budget managers may learn of available funds late, limiting opportunities for reinvestment. | Governance structures are established, and oversight is improving. Meetings are scheduled, and financial data is provided, though depth and timeliness may still lack.
