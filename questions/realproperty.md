# **REAL PROPERTY**

| Question | Result Type | Result that would flag compliance concern | Policy/Legislative requirement | Why this is important |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. How frequently does the Deputy Head meet with the Senior Designated Official for Real Property to discuss real property matters? | Frequency: - Less than annually - Annually - Less than quarterly but more than annually - Quarterly - More frequently than quarterly | Less than annually or annually | Policy on the Planning and Management of Investments (PPMI) 4.1 | The deputy head has ultimate accountability for the sound management of real property. As such, regular briefings from the Senior Designated Official for Real Property are critical in the deputy ensuring that their delegated authorities within the real property program are being managed. |
| 2. Based on data reported in the Directory of Federal Real Property, how has the condition of the organization’s real property portfolio changed over the last 3 fiscal years? | Percentage | Less than 0% for good and fair <br> Higher than 0% for poor and critical | PPMI 4.1.4.1 <br> Directive on the Management of Real Property (DMRP) 4.2.4 | A robust real property portfolio strategy drives change by describing how an organization’s real property assets will be intentionally and proactively managed. It shows an organization’s ability to make real property investment decisions that demonstrate best value and sound stewardship. |
| 3. For transactions completed by the organization in the last fiscal year, what proportion of these transactions have complete documentation to demonstrate compliance with relevant legal and policy requirements? | Percentage | Less than 90% | PPMI 4.1.3 <br> DMRP 4.1.1.4 | There are numerous legal and policy requirements to ensure that real property transactions are conducted in a fair, open and transparent manner, while demonstrating proper delegation of authorities and value to the Crown. |
| 4. What is the organization’s actual reinvestment rate for real property compared to its target reinvestment rate? | Percentage | Less than 60% | PPMI 4.1.18.8 | Establishing a target rate of annual reinvestment and understanding deferred maintenance liabilities for Crown-owned (custodial) real property is essential to assessing whether adequate resources are being dedicated to maintaining real property assets in an acceptable condition. Further, a comparison of the actual rate of reinvestment with the target rate may identify opportunities for deputy heads to adjust resource allocations to demonstrate sound stewardship and best value to the Crown. If the rate is not met, it suggests that real property assets are at risk of deteriorating faster than life-cycle forecasts predict, which may compromise program and service delivery. |
| 5. What is the level of maturity of the organization’s real property governance? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | PPMI 4.1, 4.1.3.3, 4.1.3.4, 4.1.4.1, <br> DMRP 4.1.2 | The Real Property Management Framework and associated governance structure outlines the organization’s ability to make real property investment decisions that demonstrate best value and sound stewardship. |
| 6. What is the level of maturity of the organization’s management of its real property assets? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | PPMI 4.1.18.1, 4.1.4, 4.1.1 <br> DMRP 4.1.2 | A strong asset management regime ensures that organizations have the real property necessary to accomplish their mandates and that their real property holdings provide best value. Having a lifecycle management plan in place minimizes the risk of loss and damage to real property holdings to ensure operational continuity. It also provides real property management practitioners with up-to-date information on the state of their real property assets to enable effective management through data-driven decision making for lifecycle maintenance, and the identification of surplus real property. |
| 7. What is the level of maturity of the organization’s real property transaction management? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | PPMI 4.1.18.1, 4.1.4, 4.1.1 | There are numerous legal and policy requirements to ensure that real property transactions are conducted in a fair, open and transparent manner, while demonstrating proper delegation of authorities and value to the Crown. |
| 8. What is the level of maturity of how the organization identifies and tracks against the target reinvestment rate using asset data? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | PPMI 4.1.18.1, 4.1.3.4, 4.1.3.5 | Understanding the need for a specific target rate of annual reinvestment and understanding deferred maintenance liabilities for Crown-owned (custodial) real property demonstrates an understanding of the portfolio’s requirements and is essential to assessing whether adequate resources are being dedicated to maintaining real property assets in an acceptable condition. Further, a comparison of the actual rate of reinvestment with the target rate may identify opportunities for deputy heads to adjust resource allocations in order to demonstrate sound stewardship and best value to the Crown. If the rate is not met, it suggests that real property assets are at risk of deteriorating faster than life-cycle forecasts predict, which may compromise program and service delivery. |

REAL PROPERTY: How organizations will calculate self-assessment responses

|  |  |  |  |  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1: How frequently does the Deputy Head meet with the Senior Designated Official for Real Property to discuss real property matters? | Organizations are asked to select the frequency that best represents their response. <br>- Less than annually - Annually - Less than quarterly but more than annually<br>- Quarterly - More frequently than quarterly | A response of less than annually or annually indicates a potential compliance concern that may require deputy head attention. |  |  |
| Q2: Based on data reported in the Directory of Federal Real Property, how has the condition of the organization’s real property portfolio changed over the last 3 fiscal years? | Calculation method: <br> For properties in "good" and "fair" condition: Percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" and "fair" building condition for the most recent fiscal year – Percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" or "fair" condition 3 fiscal years ago = Response<br> How to calculate the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" and "fair" building condition for the most recent fiscal year. <br>Step 1: The organization is asked to count the number of its real property assets in "good" and "fair" building condition as per the Directory of Federal Real Property (DFRP) in the most recent fiscal year.<br>Step 2: The organization is asked to count the total number of its real property buildings per the DFRP in the most recent fiscal year.<br> Step 3: Divide the total number of real property assets in "good" and "fair" building condition by the total number of real property buildings per the data available in the DFRP.<br>Step 4: Multiply the number calculated in Step 3 by 100 to determine the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" and "fair" building condition for the most recent fiscal year. <br> How to calculate the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "poor" and "critical" condition for the most recent fiscal year. <br> Step 5: The organization is asked to count the number of its real property assets in "poor" and "critical" building condition as per the DFRP from 3 fiscal years ago.<br>Step 6: The organization is asked to count the total number of its real property assets from 3 fiscal years ago.<br> Step 7: Divide the total number of real property assets in "poor" and "critical" building condition from 3 years fiscal ago by the total number of real property assets from 3 fiscal years ago.<br>Step 8: Multiply the number calculated in Step 7 by 100 to determine the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "poor" and "critical" condition 3 fiscal years ago. How to calculate the response<br>Step 9: Subtract the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "good" and "fair" condition for the most recent fiscal year from the percentage of an organization’s real property portfolio in "poor" and "critical" condition 3 fiscal years ago to determine the organization's response to this question in the self-assessment.  | If the condition trend of properties in "good" and "fair" condition shows a decrease (a response less than 0%), it indicates a potential compliance concern that may require a response from the deputy head. If the condition trend of properties in "poor" and "critical" condition shows an increase (a response higher than 0%), it indicates a potential compliance concern that may require a response from the deputy head. | Notes: The DFRP contains core information about the properties and buildings that currently support the fulfillment of federal program requirements. It excludes certain types of real property assets, including easements and access roads, interests under a certain size, offshore oil and gas lands, real property that is a reserve as defined in the Indian Act, non-agent Crown corporation holdings, and engineering assets. Please see the DFRP Input Guide for the complete list of exclusions. <br> A property is defined as a contiguous portion of land or improvements on the land administered by a single custodian and held under a single interest type. A building is defined as a structure that is permanently fixed to the land, usually roofed and walled, used or built for the shelter, accommodation or enclosure of persons, animals, materials or equipment. The definition excludes any structure or work, such as an object, that serves the purpose of a building but that is not fixed to the land. Such temporary structures, such as a trailer or mobile home, are considered materiel and not real property and are therefore not reportable in the DFRP. |  |

# FINANCIAL AND EXPENDITURE MANAGEMENT

| Question | Result Type | Result that would flag compliance concern | Policy/Legislative requirement | Why this is important |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Did the organization conduct a full risk assessment or environmental scan of its internal controls over financial management and internal controls over financial reporting in 2024-25 and use the results to inform its internal control monitoring strategy? | Yes/No | No | Guide to Ongoing Monitoring of Internal Controls over Financial Management, Section 5 <br> Financial Administration Act 16.4<br> Policy on Financial Management 4.1.6 | Organizations should be aware of their current risk environment to ensure controls are designed to mitigate organizational risks are based on the most recent information available. <br> Organizations must also ensure the rigour of the risk assessments are sufficiently high. Organizations need to be confident that they understand their risks thoroughly so that they are testing their controls in accordance with their business process risk level. A thorough understanding of risks also provides an opportunity for the organization to ensure controls are designed appropriately to mitigate the organizational risks based on the most recent information available. |
| 2. What percentage of remediation actions for medium and high-risk internal control gaps or weaknesses were fully implemented within the established timelines during fiscal years 2022-23 to 2024-25? | Percentage - Organizations should select not applicable (N/A) if no remediation actions have been identified in the past three years. | Less than 75% | Guide to Ongoing Monitoring of Internal Controls over Financial Management, Section 5 <br> Policy on Financial Management 4.1.6 | Deficiencies in internal controls over financial management and reporting should be remediated in a timely fashion to ensure controls are effective and risks are mitigated. |
| 3. What is the organization’s level of maturity in financial governance, particularly in ensuring effective oversight and integrating financial management into decision-making? | Maturity Model | Level 0 | Policy on Financial Management, 4.1.2, 4.2.2 | Organization-wide financial governance ensures strong oversight, strategic alignment, and accountability in managing public resources. By embedding financial management into decision-making, organizations can anticipate risks, optimize resource allocation, and enhance program efficiency.
