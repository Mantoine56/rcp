| Q1: Did the organization conduct a full risk assessment or environmental scan of its internal controls over financial management and internal controls over financial reporting in 2024-25 and use the results to inform its internal control monitoring strategy?                            | Organizations are asked to select the answer that best represents their response: <br>- Yes<br>- No                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | No                                           | * Guide to Ongoing Monitoring of Internal Controls over Financial Management, Section 5<br>* Financial Administration Act 16.4<br>* Policy on Financial Management 4.1.6 | Organizations should be aware of their current risk environment to ensure controls are designed to mitigate organizational risks based on the most recent information available. Organizations must also ensure the rigor of their risk assessments is sufficiently high. They need to be confident that they understand their risks thoroughly so that they are testing their controls following their business process risk level. A thorough understanding of risks also allows the organization to ensure controls are designed appropriately to mitigate the organizational risks based on the most recent information available. |
| Q2: What percentage of remediation actions for medium and high-risk internal control gaps or weaknesses were fully implemented within the established timelines during fiscal years 2022-23 to 2024-25?                                                                                    | (Total number of corrective actions implemented within established timelines / Total number of corrective actions identified) * 100 = Response<br>Step 1: The organization is asked to count the total number of property transactions with completed documentation in the last fiscal year.<br>Step 2: The organization is asked to count the total number of property transactions.<br>Step 3: Divide the total number of property transactions with completed documentation by the total number of property transactions.<br>Step 4: Multiply the number calculated in Step 3 by 100. | Less than 75%                                | * Guide to Ongoing Monitoring of Internal Controls over Financial Management, Section 5<br>* Policy on Financial Management 4.1.6        | Deficiencies in internal controls over financial management and reporting should be remediated promptly to ensure controls are effective and risks are mitigated.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Q3: What is the organization’s level of maturity in financial governance, particularly in ensuring effective oversight and integrating financial management into decision-making?                                                                                                                | Organizations should choose the maturity level which best represents its level of compliance and performance.<br>However, if an organization selects levels 1,2,3 or 4, but has not met the question's compliance elements (provided in Level 0), its response must indicate that there is a potential compliance concern and provide details about the issue. For example, "Level 3, with potential compliance concern".<br>Additional guidance about how to self-assess RCP maturity model questions can be found in the "guide on how to complete the RCP self assessments". | Level 0                                        | Policy on Financial Management, 4.1.2, 4.2.2                                                                                           | Organization-wide financial governance ensures strong oversight, strategic alignment, and accountability in managing public resources. By embedding financial management into decision-making, organizations can anticipate risks, optimize resource allocation, and enhance program efficiency. A strong governance model maintains compliance while building on it, integrating financial insights into strategic planning to support long-term sustainability and performance. At its highest level, financial governance enables data-driven decision-making, fosters transparency, and strengthens public confidence in financial stewardship. |
| Q4: What is the organization’s level of maturity in ensuring its financial information is accurate, timely and relevant to support decision-making and meet financial reporting requirements?                                                                                                    | Organizations should choose the maturity level which best represents its level of compliance and performance. However, if an organization selects levels 1,2,3 or 4, but has not met the question’s compliance elements (provided in Level 0), its response must indicate that there is a potential compliance concern and provide details about the issue. For example, "Level 3, with potential compliance concern".<br>Additional guidance about how to self-assess RCP maturity model questions can be found in the "guide on how to complete the RCP self assessments". | Level 0                                        | * Policy on Financial Management, 4.1.7, 4.2.11, 4.2.12, 4.2.13<br>* Directive on Performance and Talent Management for Executives, Appendix A<br>* Directive on Mandatory Training, subsection 4.3.2 | Organizations must ensure the accuracy, timeliness, and reliability of financial information to support informed decision-making, accountability, and transparency. High-quality financial data strengthens financial stewardship, minimizes errors, enhances forecasting, and ensures compliance with Treasury Board policies. The financial information maturity model helps organizations assess and improve their ability to produce and use financial information effectively. Ensuring robust financial information reduces reporting risks and aligns with government-wide financial management requirements. |
